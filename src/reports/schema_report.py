## Schema Overview

### Entity Types
1. **Equity** - Stock instruments with P/E ratio, dividend yield, EPS
2. **Bond** - Fixed income with yield, coupon, maturity, credit rating
3. **Commodity** - Physical assets with contracts and delivery dates
4. **Currency** - FX pairs or single-currency proxies with exchange rates and policy links
5. **Regulatory Events** - Corporate actions and SEC filings

### Relationship Types
"""

    for rel_type, count in sorted(metrics["relationship_distribution"].items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True):
        report += f"- **{rel_type}**: {count} instances\n"

    report += f"""

## Calculated Metrics

### Network Statistics
- **Total Assets**: {metrics['total_assets']}
- **Total Relationships**: {metrics['total_relationships']}
- **Average Relationship Strength**: {metrics['average_relationship_strength']:.3f}
- **Relationship Density**: {metrics['relationship_density']:.2f}%
- **Regulatory Events**: {metrics['regulatory_event_count']}

### Asset Class Distribution
"""

    for asset_class, count in sorted(metrics["asset_class_distribution"].items()):
        report += f"- **{asset_class}**: {count} assets\n"

    report += f"""

## Top Relationships
"""

    for idx, (source, target, rel_type, strength) in enumerate(metrics["top_relationships"], 1):
        report += f"{idx}. {source} → {target} ({rel_type}): {strength:.2%}\n"

    report += """

## Business Rules & Constraints

### Cross-Asset Rules
1. **Corporate Bond Linkage**: Corporate bonds link to issuing company equity (directional)
2. **Sector Affinity**: Assets in same sector have baseline relationship strength of 0.7 (bidirectional)
3. **Currency Exposure**: Non-USD assets link to their native currency asset when available
4. **Income Linkage**: Equity dividends compared to bond yields using similarity score
5. **Commodity Exposure**: Energy equities link to crude oil; miners link to metal commodities

### Regulatory Rules
1. **Event Propagation**: Earnings events impact related bond and currency assets
2. **Impact Scoring**: Events range from -1 (negative) to +1 (positive)
3. **Related Assets**: Each event automatically creates relationships to impacted securities

### Valuation Rules
1. **Bond-Stock Spread**: Corporate bond yield - equity dividend yield indicates relative value
2. **Sector Rotation**: Commodity prices trigger evaluation of sector exposure
3. **Currency Adjustment**: All cross-border assets adjusted for FX exposure

## Schema Optimization Metrics

### Data Quality Score: """
