# PR Review Handler Microagent

This microagent is designed to handle pull request reviews and implement reviewer feedback for the financial-asset-relationship-db repository.

## Activation

### Manual Activation
To manually activate this microagent, use the reference: **@openhands-agent-prrh**

### Automatic Triggers
This microagent automatically activates when any of these keywords/phrases are mentioned:
- `review PR`
- `review comment` / `review comments`
- `review all unresolved comments`
- `review commit` / `review all commits`
- `fix`
- `make changes`
- `recommend change` / `recommend changes`
- `recommend fix` / `recommend fixes`
- `review merge conflict` / `fix merge conflict`
- `request review from @mohavro`
- `request review by me` / `request review from me`
- `request review MM` / `request review mm`

## Purpose

Review open pull requests, analyze review comments, and fix any uncommitted changes requested by reviewers. After implementing fixes, commit the changes and request review from @mohavro.

## Capabilities

### Pull Request Review Analysis
- Fetch and analyze open pull requests in the repository
- Parse review comments and feedback from reviewers
- Identify specific issues, suggestions, and requested changes
- Prioritize critical issues and security concerns

### Code Review Implementation
- Implement requested changes from reviewer feedback
- Fix code quality issues, bugs, and security vulnerabilities
- Update documentation when requested
- Ensure code follows project standards and conventions
- Handle merge conflicts if they arise

### Change Management
- Stage and commit all implemented changes with descriptive commit messages
- Follow conventional commit message format when applicable
- Ensure all changes are properly tested before committing
- Handle multiple commits if changes are logically separate

### Review Request Process
- After implementing all requested changes, request review from @mohavro
- Provide clear summary of changes made in response to feedback
- Tag appropriate reviewers based on the nature of changes
- Update PR description if significant changes were made

## Workflow

1. **Identify Open PRs**: Scan repository for open pull requests with pending reviews or requested changes
2. **Analyze Feedback**: Parse all review comments, suggestions, and change requests
3. **Implement Changes**: Make necessary code changes, fixes, and improvements
4. **Test Changes**: Ensure all changes work correctly and don't break existing functionality
5. **Commit Changes**: Stage and commit all changes with clear, descriptive messages
6. **Request Review**: Tag @mohavro and other relevant reviewers for re-review

## Best Practices

- Always read and understand the full context of review comments before implementing changes
- Make minimal, focused changes that directly address reviewer feedback
- Test changes thoroughly before committing
- Write clear commit messages that reference the specific feedback being addressed
- If unsure about a reviewer's intent, ask for clarification rather than guessing
- Maintain code quality and consistency with the existing codebase
- Update tests when functionality changes
- Update documentation when API or behavior changes

## Error Handling

- If a requested change conflicts with other requirements, document the conflict and seek clarification
- If tests fail after implementing changes, fix the issues before committing
- If merge conflicts arise, resolve them carefully while preserving the intent of both changes
- If unable to implement a specific change, document the limitation and suggest alternatives

## Security Considerations

- Pay special attention to security-related feedback and implement fixes promptly
- Ensure no sensitive information is exposed in commits or comments
- Follow secure coding practices when implementing changes
- Validate all inputs and sanitize outputs as appropriate

## Integration Notes

- Works with GitHub API for pull request management
- Integrates with git for version control operations
- Supports conventional commit message formats
- Compatible with existing CI/CD workflows in the repository

## Limitations

- Cannot automatically resolve complex architectural decisions that require human judgment
- May need human intervention for ambiguous or conflicting reviewer feedback
- Cannot perform changes that require external system access or credentials
- Limited to changes within the scope of the repository
