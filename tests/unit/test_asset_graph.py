"""Unit tests for AssetRelationshipGraph.

This module contains comprehensive unit tests for the asset relationship graph including:
- Graph initialization and asset management
- Relationship creation (directional and bidirectional)
- Automatic relationship discovery algorithms
- Relationship strength calculation and clamping
- Metric calculation (totals, averages, distributions, density)
- 3D visualization data generation with deterministic positioning
- Regulatory event integration and impact modeling
